# Video Poker

Inspired by the 80s arcade game poker ladies. 

I originally made this for Android because I wanted a video poker app that didn't have a bunch of ads in it. I made this C++ port just because I was bored, so don't expect too much. It is rough around the edges and it was originally designed for touchscreen, but it is functional video poker.

HOW TO PLAY:

It is jacks-or-better video poker. I don't have to explain that right?

Start with one of eleven dealers. 

Each hand played earns affection, which gradually unlocks new dealer portraits. 

If you run out of money in the bank, you have to start over from the begining. 

TIP: If you don't know which cards to hold, you can click the dealer for a hint.
